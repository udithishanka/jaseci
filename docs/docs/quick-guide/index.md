# Welcome to Jac

**The Only Language You Need to Build Anything**

Jac is a programming language designed for humans and AI to build together. It supersets Python and JavaScript with native compilation support, adding constructs that let you weave AI into your code, model complex domains as graphs, and deploy to the cloud -- all without switching languages, managing databases, or writing infrastructure. Jac imagines what should be abstracted away from the developer and automates it through the compiler and runtime.

```jac
# A complete full-stack AI app in one file

node Todo {
    has title: str, done: bool = False;
}

enum Category { WORK, PERSONAL, SHOPPING, HEALTH, OTHER }

def categorize(title: str) -> Category
    by llm();

def:pub get_todos -> list {
    if not [root-->](?:Todo) {
        root ++> Todo(title="Buy groceries");
        root ++> Todo(title="Finish report");
    }
    return [{"title": t.title, "category": str(categorize(t.title)).split(".")[-1]}
            for t in [root-->](?:Todo)];
}

cl def:pub app() -> JsxElement {
    has items: list = [];
    async can with entry { items = await get_todos(); }
    return <div>{[<p key={i.title}>{i.title} ({i.category})</p>
                  for i in items]}</div>;
}
```

This single file defines a persistent data model, an AI-powered categorizer, a REST API, and a React frontend. No database setup. No prompt engineering. No separate frontend project. Just Jac.

??? info "You can actually run this example"
    Save the code above as `main.jac`, then create a `jac.toml` in the same directory:

    ```toml
    [project]
    name = "my-app"

    [dependencies.npm]
    jac-client-node = "1.0.4"

    [dependencies.npm.dev]
    "@jac-client/dev-deps" = "1.0.0"

    [serve]
    base_route_app = "app"

    [plugins.client]

    [plugins.byllm.model]
    default_model = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
    ```

    Install Jac, set your API key, and run:

    ```bash
    pip install jaseci
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
    jac start main.jac
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see it running. Jac supports any [LiteLLM-compatible model](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) -- use `gemini/gemini-2.5-flash` for a free alternative or `ollama/llama3.2:1b` for local models.

## The Vision

Programming today demands too much from developers that isn't their problem to solve. You want to build a product, but first you have to pick a backend language, a frontend framework, a database, an ORM, a deployment target, and then glue them all together. If you want AI, add prompt engineering to the list. If you want scale, add DevOps.

Jac takes a different approach: **move complexity out of the developer's code and into the language runtime**. The things that can be automated -- database schemas, API serialization, client-server communication, prompt construction, deployment orchestration -- should be automated. The developer should focus on *what* the application does, not *how* the plumbing works.

This philosophy rests on three pillars.

## Three Pillars

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-language-python:{ .lg .middle } **One Language**

    ---

    Write frontend, backend, and native code in a single language. Jac's **codespace** system lets you target the server (`sv`), browser (`cl`), or native binary (`na`) from the same file. The compiler handles interop -- HTTP calls, serialization, type sharing -- so you never write glue code.

- :material-robot:{ .lg .middle } **AI Native**

    ---

    Integrate LLMs at the language level with `by llm()` -- the compiler extracts semantics from your function names, types, and `sem` annotations to construct prompts automatically. First-class graphs and walkers give you an expressive agentic programming model where AI agents traverse structured state spaces with tool-calling built in.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: How by/sem Work](what-makes-jac-different.md#3-how-does-jac-abstract-away-the-laborious-task-of-promptcontext-engineering-for-ai-and-turn-it-into-a-compilerruntime-problem) · [:octicons-arrow-right-24: AI Integration Reference](../reference/plugins/byllm.md) · [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Agentic Patterns](../reference/plugins/byllm.md#agentic-ai-patterns)

- :material-cloud-outline:{ .lg .middle } **Scale Native**

    ---

    Your code doesn't change when you move from laptop to cloud. Declare `node` types and connect them to `root` -- the runtime handles persistence automatically. Run `jac start --scale` and your app deploys to Kubernetes with Redis, MongoDB, load balancing, and health checks provisioned for you. Zero DevOps.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: How Persistence Works](what-makes-jac-different.md#2-how-does-jac-fully-abstract-away-database-organization-and-interactions-and-the-complexity-of-multiuser-persistent-data) · [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Deployment Reference](../reference/plugins/jac-scale.md) · [:octicons-arrow-right-24: jac-scale Plugin](../reference/plugins/jac-scale.md)

## One Language: Frontend, Backend, Native

Jac introduces **codespaces** -- regions of code that target different execution environments. Instead of maintaining separate projects in separate languages, you write everything in Jac and the compiler produces the right output for each target:

| Codespace | Target | Ecosystem | Syntax |
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Server** | Python runtime | PyPI (`numpy`, `pandas`, `fastapi`) | `sv { }` or `.sv.jac` |
| **Client** | Browser/JavaScript | npm (`react`, `tailwind`, `@mui`) | `cl { }` or `.cl.jac` |
| **Native** | Compiled binary | C ABI | `na { }` or `.na.jac` |

Server definitions are visible to client blocks. When the client calls a server function, the compiler generates the HTTP request, serialization, and routing automatically. You write one language; the compiler produces the interop layer.

## AI Native: LLMs as Code Constructs

Jac's approach to AI is called [Meaning Typed Programming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08965). Instead of writing prompts in strings and parsing responses manually, you declare **what** you want through function signatures and let the compiler handle the **how**:

```jac
# The function name, types, and return type ARE the specification
def classify_sentiment(text: str) -> str by llm;

# Enums constrain the LLM to valid outputs
enum Priority { LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL }
def triage_ticket(description: str) -> Priority by llm();

# sem provides additional semantic context where names aren't enough
obj Ingredient {
    has name: str, cost: float, carby: bool;
}
sem Ingredient.cost = "Estimated cost in USD";
sem Ingredient.carby = "True if high in carbohydrates";

def plan_shopping(recipe: str) -> list[Ingredient] by llm();
```

The return type serves as the output contract -- `enum` means the LLM can only produce one of its values, `obj` means every field must be filled. No parsing code. No validation code. The type system enforces correctness.

For **agentic workflows**, Jac's graph constructs (nodes, edges, walkers) naturally model AI agents that traverse structured state spaces, make decisions with `by llm()`, and call tools:

```jac
def get_weather(city: str) -> str { return fetch_weather_api(city); }
def search_web(query: str) -> list[str] { return web_search_api(query); }

# The LLM decides which tools to call and in what order
def answer_question(question: str) -> str
    by llm(tools=[get_weather, search_web]);
```

## Scale Native: No Code Changes from Laptop to Cloud

Every Jac program has a built-in `root` node. Nodes reachable from `root` are **persistent** -- they survive process restarts. The runtime generates storage schemas from your node declarations. You never write database code:

```jac
node Todo { has title: str, done: bool = False; }

with entry {
    root ++> Todo(title="Learn Jac");  # Automatically persisted
}
```

This same program runs three ways with no code changes:

| Command | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `jac app.jac` | Runs locally, SQLite persistence |
| `jac start app.jac` | HTTP API server, walkers become REST endpoints |
| `jac start --scale` | Kubernetes deployment with Redis, MongoDB, load balancing |

The runtime handles database schemas, user authentication (per-user graph isolation), API generation (Swagger docs at `/docs`), caching tiers, and Kubernetes orchestration. You write application logic; the runtime handles infrastructure.

## Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Install

```bash
pip install jaseci
```

This installs the complete Jac ecosystem: `jaclang` (compiler), `byllm` (AI integration), `jac-client` (frontend), `jac-scale` (deployment), and `jac-super` (enhanced console).

Verify your installation:

```bash
jac --version
```

This also warms the cache, making subsequent commands faster.

### Step 2: Create Your First Program

Create `hello.jac`:

```jac
with entry {
    print("Hello from Jac!");
}
```

### Step 3: Run It

```bash
jac hello.jac
```

Note: `jac` is shorthand for `jac run` -- both work identically.

**That's it!** You just ran your first Jac program.
