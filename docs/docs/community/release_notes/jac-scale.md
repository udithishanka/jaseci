# Jac-Scale Release Notes

This document provides a summary of new features, improvements, and bug fixes in each version of **Jac-Scale**. For details on changes that might require updates to your existing code, please refer to the [Breaking Changes](../breaking-changes.md) page.

## jac-scale 0.2.14 (Latest Release)

- **Identity-based auth system**: Replaced flat username/password user model with a flexible identity + credential architecture. Users can register with multiple identities (username, email) and credentials (password), stored as arrays in MongoDB. Login accepts any identity type. SSO accounts are stored as identities (`type: sso`, `provider: google`) within the user document instead of a separate `sso_accounts` collection.
- **JWT user_id claim**: JWT tokens now use `user_id` (UUID) instead of `username` as the primary claim, enabling identity changes without token invalidation.
- **Feat: SV-to-SV Eager Auto-Spawn in `jac start`**: `jac start consumer.jac` now brings up every `sv import`-ed provider (including transitive ones) automatically before serving the first request, so single-host multi-service deployments need exactly one terminal and zero env vars.
- **Fix: ScaleTieredMemory Initialization**: Changed `ScaleTieredMemory.init(use_cache)` to `postinit` lifecycle method with `use_cache` as a class field, fixing initialization order issues.
- **Fix: Windows Compatibility for Local Sandbox**: Added platform guards for Unix-only APIs, cross-platform temp paths, Windows-compatible shell commands, --jac-cli sidecar support, and increased readiness timeout to 300s.
- **Fix: Spurious "write access" warnings on system root during sync**: Skip `check_write_access()` for unchanged anchors in MongoDB sync, eliminating noisy `Current root doesn't have write access to NodeAnchor Root` log spam on every authenticated request.
- **Persistence: MongoBackend gets Schema Drift + Quarantine + Aliases**: `MongoBackend` now mirrors `SqliteMemory`'s schema-migration surface -- documents are stamped with archetype identity + fingerprint, undeserializable docs route to a `<collection>_quarantine` sidecar instead of being silently dropped, and DB-resident rescue aliases live in `<collection>_aliases`. The new jaclang `jac db inspect / quarantine / alias / recover` commands work against Mongo deployments unchanged. See [Persistence & Schema Migration](../../reference/persistence.md).

- **Optional Install Groups**: Heavy dependencies (pymongo, redis, prometheus-client, apscheduler, kubernetes, docker) are no longer required by default. Install only what you need via extras: `pip install jac-scale[data]` (MongoDB + Redis), `[monitoring]` (Prometheus), `[scheduler]` (APScheduler), `[deploy]` (Kubernetes + Docker), or `[all]` for everything. Groups are combinable: `pip install jac-scale[data,monitoring]`. Missing dependencies produce clear error messages with install instructions. Existing users should use `pip install jac-scale[all]` to keep current behavior.
- **Fix: `jac start` crashes without `jac-scale[scheduler]`**: The scheduler setup in `jac start` unconditionally initialized APScheduler, causing a `'NoneType' object is not callable` error when APScheduler wasn't installed. The scheduler now gracefully degrades: static/interval/cron tasks still work via the core jaclang scheduler, and dynamic scheduling features are skipped with a clear log message when APScheduler is absent.
- 1 small refactor/change.

## jac-scale 0.2.13

- **jac-mcp included by default**: Added to the default Kubernetes package set in jac-scale.

## jac-scale 0.2.12

- **Pre-built Admin Dashboard**: The admin dashboard UI is now pre-built during the release process and shipped as static assets in the package. Previously, navigating to `/admin/` on first load triggered a full Vite build from source, causing significant lag. The server now copies bundled assets instantly, falling back to source build only in dev mode.
- **Dev Mode: Named endpoints in Swagger docs**: Dev mode (`jac start --dev`) now registers individual named endpoints (e.g. `/walker/read_todos`) instead of generic catch-all routes (`/walker/{walker_name}`), so Swagger UI shows all walker/function names. HMR still works - routes are refreshed automatically on file changes.
- **API docs enabled by default**: `/docs`, `/redoc`, and `/openapi.json` are now available in all modes (not just dev). Disable with `docs_enabled = false` in `[plugins.scale.server]`.
- 2 small refactors/changes.

## jac-scale 0.2.11

- **Fix: Sandbox status returns stale RUNNING for dead pods**: `KubernetesSandbox.status()` was returning the cached registry state (often `RUNNING`) when `read_namespaced_pod_status()` threw an exception (pod deleted or unreachable). This caused callers to believe the sandbox was still alive, preventing recovery. Now returns `STOPPED` when the pod query fails so dead pods are detected immediately.
- **Fix: Admin portal build fails from PyPI install**: `jac.toml` and `styles/*.css` were excluded from the wheel because `pyproject.toml` package-data only included `*.jac` files. The admin portal's `jac build` command needs these files to discover the project config and generate Tailwind CSS output.

## jac-scale 0.2.10

- **Dev Mode: API Docs accessible from client URL**: In dev mode (`jac start --dev`), the FastAPI Swagger UI (`/docs`) and OpenAPI spec (`/openapi.json`) are now proxied through the Vite dev server, so you can browse your API docs at the same URL as your app without switching ports.
- **Configurable API docs**: `/docs`, `/redoc`, and `/openapi.json` are controlled by the `docs_enabled` setting in `[plugins.scale.server]` (defaults to `true`). Set `docs_enabled = false` to hide them in production.
- **Health check endpoint**: Added `GET /healthz` for liveness checks. Returns `{"status": "ok"}` with no authentication required. Useful for Kubernetes probes and monitoring.
- **Warm Pool TTL**: Added `warm_pool_ttl` config to control warm pod lifetime independently from sandbox `ttl_seconds`. Default `0` means warm pods live indefinitely until claimed, preventing the pool from emptying after the sandbox TTL expires.

## jac-scale 0.2.9

- **Ingress Rate Limiting (DDoS Protection)**: Added configurable NGINX rate limiting to the Kubernetes ingress. Limits sustained requests per second, burst headroom, and concurrent connections per client IP using the leaky bucket algorithm. Returns `429 Too Many Requests` when limits are exceeded. Configurable via `[plugins.scale.kubernetes]` in `jac.toml`: `ingress_limit_rps` (default: 20), `ingress_limit_burst_multiplier` (default: 5), `ingress_limit_connections` (default: 20).
- **Cookie-Based Sticky Sessions (optional)**: Added opt-in session affinity via NGINX cookie (`route`). When enabled, every user is pinned to the same pod regardless of IP changes (mobile, NAT, proxies). Cookie never expires in the browser. On pod failure NGINX automatically re-routes and rewrites the cookie. Enabled by default. Disable via `ingress_session_affinity = false` in `[plugins.scale.kubernetes]`.
- **Performance: MongoBackend.batch_get()**: New `batch_get(ids)` uses `find({_id: {$in: [...]}})` so edge traversals hit MongoDB with 2-3 queries instead of one per anchor. On cold starts with 100 edges this cuts 201 round-trips down to 3.
- **Extensible Deployment Targets and Image Registries**: `DeploymentTargetFactory` and `ImageRegistryFactory` now support plugin-registered targets via `register(name, factory)`. External packages can register custom deployment targets (e.g. `DeploymentTargetFactory.register("enterprise-kubernetes", my_factory)`) and image registries without modifying jac-scale. Custom targets load their config from `[plugins.scale.<target-name>]` in `jac.toml`.
- **PWA/Web Target Integration Test**: Added test to verify `jac start --client pwa` uses jac-scale's FastAPI server when installed (checks `/docs` endpoint availability).
- **Fix: HPA config ignored on redeployment**: `create_hpa` silently swallowed 409 Conflict errors when the HPA already existed, so updated `min_replicas`, `max_replicas`, and `cpu_utilization_target` values in `jac.toml` were never applied on subsequent deploys. Changed to a replace-first, create-on-404 pattern consistent with how Ingress and ConfigMap resources are managed, ensuring HPA configuration is always kept in sync with `jac.toml`.
- **Sandbox Security Hardening**: Hardened K8s sandbox pods by dropping all Linux capabilities (`drop: ALL`), enabling seccomp `RuntimeDefault` profile (~44 dangerous syscalls blocked), disabling service account token automounting (prevents K8s API access from inside sandboxes), and adding a configurable `/app` emptyDir size limit (`app_storage_limit`, default 1Gi) to prevent node disk exhaustion. Applied consistently to both on-demand and warm pool pods. The sandbox base Dockerfile now creates a dedicated non-root user (`jac`, UID 1000) and installs Bun system-wide so it's accessible under the security context.

## jac-scale 0.2.8

- 1 small changes.

## jac-scale 0.2.7

- **Apple & GitHub SSO Support**: Added Apple Sign In and GitHub as SSO providers via `fastapi-sso`. Unified the SSO callback into a single endpoint per platform (`/sso/{platform}/callback`) that auto-registers new users or logs in existing ones. Initiation endpoints remain separate (`/sso/{platform}/login`, `/sso/{platform}/register`). SSO `host` config simplified to just the base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`). Configure via `[plugins.scale.sso.apple]` and `[plugins.scale.sso.github]` in `jac.toml`.
- **Kubernetes Security Hardening**: Added container-level security contexts (`allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `drop: ALL`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`), dedicated `ServiceAccount` per workload, component-specific NetworkPolicies enforcing proper isolation (databases only accept traffic from main app + dashboards, monitoring components only accept ingress from trusted internal sources), and `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: baseline` namespace labels.
- **Scheduler Code Quality Cleanup**: Extracted shared `_authenticate_request()` and `_validate_trigger()` helpers to remove duplicated auth/validation logic across `/jobs` endpoints. Fixed `get_job()` to query by ID directly instead of loading all jobs. Replaced deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`. Persisted `is_walker` in job data to avoid redundant introspector lookups. Replaced silent exception swallowing with debug logging.
- **Metrics Endpoint Fix & Prometheus Auth**: Fixed `/metrics` 500 error (`TransportResponse` is a dataclass, not Pydantic - replaced `.model_dump()` with `dataclasses.asdict()`). Added HTTP Basic Auth support so Prometheus can scrape `/metrics` via `basic_auth` in `prometheus.yml`.
- **Hash-based dirty checking for MongoDB/Redis persistence**: Replaced `is_updated` flag with hash-based change detection at sync time. Read-only requests no longer trigger any database writes. All mutation types, including in-place mutations (`list.append()`, `dict[k]=v`, `set.add()`, nested objects), are automatically detected and persisted.
- **Client-Side Error Reporting Endpoint**: Added `POST /cl/__error__` endpoint to `JacAPIServerCore` for receiving client-side JavaScript errors. Errors are logged via the `jaclang.client_errors` logger and printed to the dev console with stack traces for visibility.
- **Source-Mapped Error Stack Traces**: Client error stack traces received at `/cl/__error__` are now resolved from bundled JS locations to original `.jac` file paths and exact line numbers via the centralized `SourceMapper` with two-layer resolution.
- **Client Error Rate Limiting**: The `/cl/__error__` endpoint now deduplicates identical error messages (10s window) and caps at 20 errors per minute to prevent log flooding from render loops or repeated failures.
- **Add: LLM Telemetry Admin Dashboard**: Added a `TelemetryStore` backend that subscribes to byllm's agent callback and litellm's per-call logger, grouping all LLM calls within a single agent invocation into one trace (tokens, cost, latency, user prompt, agent response). Traces are served via four new admin REST endpoints (`/admin/llm/telemetry/summary`, `/traces`, `/traces/{id}`, `/filters`) and visualized in the admin UI with a metrics overview page and a paginated, filterable trace detail view.
- **Fix: Nginx error when domain is set before `--enable-tls`**: Ingress now always deploys with a wildcard rule; the domain `host` is only applied when `--enable-tls` is run, fixing the app being unreachable via IP/NLB when `domain` was set in `jac.toml` before initial deployment.
- **Sandbox System**: Isolated preview environments with Docker and Kubernetes backends, warm pod pool, routing proxy with WebSocket/HMR, and path-safe file operations. Configure via `[plugins.scale.sandbox]` in `jac.toml`.
- **Request-Scoped L1 Memory Cache**: Made the L1 (in-memory) cache request-scoped using `ContextVar`, ensuring each request gets an isolated cache that is automatically cleared after execution, preventing stale data, memory leaks, and cross-request interference while maintaining backward compatibility for CLI and tests.

## jac-scale 0.2.6

- **Domain & TLS support (`--enable-tls`)**: Added custom domain name routing and automatic HTTPS via cert-manager + Let's Encrypt. Set `domain` in `jac.toml`, deploy normally, point your CNAME to the NLB, then run `jac start app.jac --scale --enable-tls` to enable HTTPS without a full redeploy. cert-manager is installed automatically and certificates are renewed automatically. Configurable via `domain` and `cert_manager_email` in `[plugins.scale.kubernetes]`.

## jac-scale 0.2.5

- **Fix: Walker Route OpenAPI Parameter Naming**: Fixed inconsistency where walker routes with node parameters used `{nd}` in URL paths but declared `node` in OpenAPI schema, causing FastAPI validation errors (`"Field required"` for parameter `node`). The OpenAPI schema now correctly uses `nd` to match the actual path variable and function parameter. This fixes requests to `/walker/{walker_name}/{node_id}` endpoints. Note: `node` is a reserved Jac keyword, so `nd` is used as the parameter name throughout.
- **Fix: K8s deployment time regression**: NGINX Ingress controller now starts in parallel with databases/monitoring, restoring test runtimes.
- **NGINX Ingress Controller**: Replaced individual NodePort services with a single NGINX Ingress controller. All services are now ClusterIP, accessible via path-based routing through `ingress_node_port` (default: `30080`): `/` app, `/grafana`, `/cache-dashboard/`, `/db-dashboard`.
- **Fix: Ingress routes now update correctly on re-deploy**: Switched from `patch` to `replace` for Ingress resources so toggling monitoring or dashboards off actually removes the old routes instead of leaving them in place.
- **Security: RedisInsight always requires authentication**: The `/cache-dashboard` route now always enforces HTTP basic-auth when `redis_dashboard = true`. Credentials are hashed with bcrypt (replaces the previous SHA1 scheme). The auth Secret is also cleaned up automatically when `redis_dashboard` is disabled.
- Fix: Redis Insight dashboard 404 and nginx-auth ConfigMap not updating on re-deploy.
- **Fix: Parser Strictness Compliance**: Moved docstrings before signatures in `kubernetes_utils.impl.jac` and converted nested function docstring to comment in `api.cl.jac` to comply with the stricter RD parser.
- [Internal] Refactor: Extract graph visualizer HTML into a standalone template file.
- **User storage now supports both MongoDB and SQLite**: User authentication and management automatically uses SQLite when MongoDB is not configured, maintaining full backward compatibility with existing installations.
- **Fix: Include `redis.conf.template` in package distribution**: Fixed `FileNotFoundError` during Redis deployment when jac-scale is installed via pip (non-editable install). The `redis.conf.template` file is now correctly included in the wheel distribution via `package-data` configuration in `pyproject.toml`.

## jac-scale 0.2.4

- **Automatic Port Fallback**: When starting the server with `jac start`, if the specified port is already in use, the server now automatically finds and uses the next available port instead of crashing with "Address already in use". A warning message displays when using an alternative port. Supports up to 10 port retries with cross-platform compatibility (Linux and Windows).
- [fix]Fix for internet facing aws load balancer
- 1 Minor refactor/change.
- **Scheduling Support**: Added static and dynamic task scheduling for walkers and functions via `@schedule(trigger=...)`. Static schedules (INTERVAL/CRON/DATE) start automatically at server startup; dynamic schedules (DYNAMIC) are managed via a new `/jobs` REST API (create, list, get, update, delete) with MongoDB persistence. Scheduled items are excluded from standard walker/function endpoints. A `__system__` user executes all scheduled tasks; configure via `[plugins.scale.scheduler]` in `jac.toml`.
- **Fix**: Fix for internet-facing AWS load balancer
- [Internal] Convert username and password for redis and mongodb to secret when injecting to pod deployment
- 3 Minor refactors/changes.
- update jac-scale plugin documentation with missing features
- APP_NAME, K8s_NAMESPACE, DOCKER_USERNAME, DOCKER_PASSWORD are no longer read from environment variables and must be configured via `jac.toml.

- **Component-Level Destroy**: `jac destroy app.jac --component <name>` now supports removing individual Kubernetes components (`application`, `database`, `cache`, `monitoring`, `dashboard`) without tearing down the entire deployment.
- **Redis Cache Configuration with TTL Support**: Added configurable eviction policies and TTL support for Kubernetes Redis deployments via `jac.toml` (`redis_max_memory`, `redis_eviction_policy`, `redis_eviction_samples`, `redis_default_ttl`, `redis_enable_keyspace_notifications`); ConfigMap-based with automatic pod restart on change. Anchors stored in Redis L2 cache now respect the `redis_default_ttl` setting and will automatically expire after the configured duration (default: 0 = no expiration).
- 1 small refactor/change.
- **Fix: Redis deployment annotation null guard**: Fixed `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` crash during `jac start --scale` when an existing Redis deployment has no annotations. Kubernetes returns `None` for the annotations field when none exist, so the config-hash check now guards against this.

## jac-scale 0.2.3

- **Admin API Endpoints**: REST API for administrative operations at `/admin/*` including user management, SSO provider listing, and configuration access.
- **Admin-Only Metrics Endpoint**: The `/metrics` Prometheus scrape endpoint now requires admin authentication. Unauthenticated requests receive a 403 Forbidden response. This prevents unauthorized access to server performance data.
- **Admin Metrics Dashboard**: Added `/admin/metrics` endpoint that returns parsed Prometheus metrics as structured JSON with summary statistics (total requests, average latency, error rate, active requests). The admin dashboard monitoring page now displays metrics in a visual dashboard with HTTP traffic breakdown, system stats (GC, memory, CPU time), and real-time counters.
- Set default maximum memory limit of k8s pods from unlimited to 12Gb
- Automatically deploy Redis (RedisInsight) and MongoDB (MongoDB Dashboard) dashboards in Kubernetes when the redis_dashboard and mongodb_dashboard flags are enabled.
- Set default maximum memory limit for jaseci app pod to None (unlimited)
- 1 Minor refactor/change.

## jac-scale 0.2.2

- **Data Persists Across Server Restarts**: Graph nodes and edges created during a session now persist automatically in MongoDB. When you restart your `jac start` server, previously created data is restored and accessible - no manual save operations required.
- **`jac status` Command**: New `jac status app.jac` command to check the live deployment status of all Kubernetes components (Jaseci App, Redis, MongoDB, Prometheus, Grafana). Displays a color-coded table with component health, pod readiness counts, and service URLs. Detects running, degraded, pending, restarting (crash-loop), and not-deployed states.
- **Resource Tagging**: All Kubernetes resources created by jac-scale are now labeled with `managed: jac-scale`, enabling easy auditing and identification via `kubectl get all -l managed=jac-scale -A`.
- k8s metrics dashboard in prometheus and grafana
- Jac status command to check deployment status of each component of k8s
- **Chore: Codebase Reformatted**: All `.jac` files reformatted with improved `jac format` (better line-breaking, comment spacing, and ternary indentation).
- **Fix: Root-Level Font/Asset 404s**: Added `.jac/client/dist/` as a search candidate in `serve_root_asset`, fixing 404s for font files (`.woff2`, `.ttf`, etc.) bundled by Vite with root-relative `@font-face url()` paths.

## jac-scale 0.2.1

- **Admin Portal**: Added a built-in `/admin` dashboard for user management and administration. Features include user CRUD operations (list, create, edit, delete), role-based access control with `admin`, `moderator`, and `user` roles, force password reset, and SSO account management view.
- **Admin API Endpoints**: REST API for administrative operations at `/admin/*` including user management, SSO provider listing, and configuration access.
- **Admin Configuration**: New `[plugins.scale.admin]` section in `jac.toml` to configure admin portal settings. Environment variables `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, and `ADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` supported.
- **Refactor: `JacSerializer` removed, use `Serializer(api_mode=True)`**: `JacSerializer` has been removed from `jaclang.runtimelib.server`. API serialization is now handled directly by `Serializer.serialize(obj, api_mode=True)` from `jaclang.runtimelib.serializer`. Storage backends are unaffected; continue using `Serializer.serialize(obj, include_type=True)` for round-trip persistence. Added `social_graph.jac` fixture demonstrating native persistence with `db.find_nodes()` for querying the `_anchors` collection using MongoDB filters.
- Internal: refactor jac-scale k8s loadbalancer/service to support other vendors
- Before deploying to the local Kubernetes cluster, check whether the required NodePorts are already in use in any namespace; if they are, throw an error.
- jac destroy command deletes non default namespace
- **Fix: Code-sync pod stuck in ContainerCreating**: Added preferred `podAffinity` to the code-sync pod spec so it prefers scheduling on the same node as the code-server pod. Fixes RWO (ReadWriteOnce) PVC mount failures when Kubernetes schedules the two pods on different nodes.
- 1 Minor refactor
- Internal: check whether redis,mongodb,grafana and prometheus are also restarted when checking deployment status

## jac-scale 0.2.0

- **SSO Frontend Callback Redirect**: SSO callback endpoints now support automatic redirection to frontend applications. Configure `client_auth_callback_url` in `jac.toml` to redirect with token/error parameters instead of returning JSON, enabling seamless browser-based OAuth flows.
- **Graph Visualization Tests**: Added tests for `/graph` and `/graph/data` endpoints.

## jac-scale 0.1.11

- **Graph Visualization Endpoint (`/graph`)**: Added a built-in `/graph` endpoint that serves an interactive graph visualization UI in the browser.

## jac-scale 0.1.10

- **support horizontal scaling**:  based on average cpu usage k8s pods are horizontally scaled
- **Client Build Error Diagnostics**: Build errors now display formatted diagnostic output with error codes, source snippets, and quick fix suggestions instead of raw Vite/Rollup output. Uses the `jac-client` diagnostic engine for consistent error formatting across `jac start` and `jac build`.

## jac-scale 0.1.9

- **Refactor: Modular JacAPIServer Architecture**: Split the monolithic `serve.impl.jac` into three focused impl files using mixin composition:
  - `serve.core.impl.jac`: Auth, user management, JWT, API keys, server start/postinit
  - `serve.endpoints.impl.jac`: Walker, function, webhook, WebSocket endpoint registration
  - `serve.static.impl.jac`: Static files, pages, client JS, graph visualization
- **Fix: `@restspec` Path Parameters**: Resolved a critical bug where using `@restspec` with URL path parameters (e.g. `path="/items/{item_id}"`) caused the server to crash on startup with `Cannot use 'Query' for path param 'id'`. Both functions and walkers with `@restspec` path templates now correctly annotate matching parameters as `Path()` instead of `Query()`. Mixed usage (path params alongside query params or body params) works correctly across GET and POST methods. Starlette converter syntax (e.g. `{file_path:path}`) is also handled.
- **Remove Authorization header input from Swagger UI**: The `Authorization` header is no longer exposed as a visible text input field in Swagger UI for walker, function, and API key endpoints. Authentication tokens are now read transparently from the standard `Authorization` request header (accessible via the lock icon), consistent with the `update_username` and `update_password` endpoints.
- 1 Minor refactors/changes.

## jac-scale 0.1.8

- Internal: K8s integration tests now install jac plugins from fork PRs instead of always using main
- **.jac folder is excluded when creating the zip folder that is uploaded into jaseci deployment pods.Fasten up deployment**
- **Fix: `jac start` Startup Banner**: Server now displays the startup banner (URLs, network IPs, mode info) correctly via `on_ready` callback, consistent with stdlib server behavior.
- Various refactors
- **PWA Build Detection**: Server startup now detects existing PWA builds (via `manifest.json`) and skips redundant client bundling. The `/static/client.js` endpoint serves Vite-hashed files (`client.*.js`) in PWA mode.
- **Prometheus Metrics Integration**: Added `/metrics` endpoint with HTTP request metrics, configurable via `[plugins.scale.metrics]
` in `jac.toml`.
- Update jaseci scale k8s pipeline to support parellel test cases.
- **early exit from k8s deployment if container restarted**
- **Direct Database Access (`kvstore`)**: Added `kvstore()` function for direct MongoDB and Redis operations without graph layer. Supports database-specific methods (MongoDB: `find_one`, `insert_one`, `update_one`; Redis: `set_with_ttl`, `incr`, `scan_keys`) with common methods (`get`, `set`, `delete`, `exists`) working across both. Import from `jac_scale.lib` with URI-based connection pooling and configuration fallback (explicit URI → env vars → jac.toml).
- **Code refactors**: Backtick escape, etc.
- **Persistent Webhook API Keys**: Webhook API key metadata is now stored in MongoDB (`webhook_api_keys` collection) instead of in-memory dictionaries. API keys now survive server restarts.
- **Native Kubernetes Secret support**: New `[plugins.scale.secrets]` config section. Declare secrets with `${ENV_VAR}` syntax, auto-resolved at deploy time into a K8s Secret with `envFrom.secretRef`.
- **Minor Internal Refactor in Tests**: Minor internal refactoring in test_direct.py to improve test structure
- **fix**: Return 401 instead of 500 for deleted users with valid JWT tokens.
- Docs update: return type `any` -> `JsxElement`
- **1 Small Refactors**
- **promethius and grafana deployment**: Jac-scale automatically deploys promethius and grafana and connect with metrics endpoint.

## jac-scale 0.1.7

- **KWESC_NAME syntax changed from `<>` to backtick**: Updated keyword-escaped names from `<>` prefix to backtick prefix to match the jaclang grammar change.
- **Update syntax for TYPE_OP removal**: Replaced backtick type operator syntax (`` `root ``) with `Root` and filter syntax (``(`?Type)``) with `[?:Type]` across all docs, tests, examples, and README.

## jac-scale 0.1.6

- **WebSocket Support**: Added WebSocket transport for walkers via `@restspec(protocol=APIProtocol.WEBSOCKET)` with persistent bidirectional connections at `ws://host/ws/{walker_name}`. The `APIProtocol` enum (`HTTP`, `WEBHOOK`, `WEBSOCKET`) replaces the previous `webhook=True` flag-migrate by changing `@restspec(webhook=True)` to `@restspec(protocol=APIProtocol.WEBHOOK)`.

- **fix: Exclude `jac.local.toml` during K8s code sync**: The local dev override file (`jac.local.toml`) is now excluded when syncing application code to the Kubernetes PVC. Previously, this file could override deployment settings such as the serve port, causing health check failures.

## jac-scale 0.1.5

- **JsxElement Return Types**: Updated all JSX component return types from `any` to `JsxElement` for compile-time type safety.
- **Client bundle error help message**: When the client bundle build fails during `jac start`, the server now prints a troubleshooting suggestion to run `jac clean --all` and a link to the Discord community for support.

## jac-scale 0.1.4

- **Console infrastructure**: Replaced bare `print()` calls with `console` abstraction for consistent output formatting.
- **Hot fix: call state**: Normal spawn calls inside API spawn calls supported.
- **`--no_client` flag support**: Server startup now honors the `--no_client` flag, skipping eager client bundling when the client bundle is built separately, adn we need server only.
- **PyJWT version pinned**: Pinned `pyjwt` to `>=2.10.1,<2.11.0` and updated default JWT secret to meet minimum key length requirements.

## jac-scale 0.1.3

- **GET Method Support**: Added full support for HTTP GET requests for both walkers and functions, including correct mapping of query parameters, support for both dynamic (HMR) and static endpoints, and customization via `@restspec(method=HTTPMethod.GET)`.

- **Streaming Response Support**: Streaming responses are supported with walker spawn calls and function calls.
- **Webhook Support**: Added webhook transport for walkers with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification. Walkers can be configured with `@restspec(webhook=True)` to receive webhook requests at `/webhook/{walker_name}` endpoints with API key authentication and signature verification.

- **Storage Abstraction**: Introduced a pluggable storage abstraction layer for file operations.
  - Abstract `Storage` interface with standard operations: `upload`, `download`, `delete`, `list`, `copy`, `move`, `get_metadata`
  - Default `LocalStorage` implementation in `jaclang.runtimelib.storage`
  - Hookable `store(base_path, create_dirs)` builtin that returns a configured `Storage` instance
  - Configure via `jac.toml [storage]` section or `JAC_STORAGE_PATH` / `JAC_STORAGE_CREATE_DIRS` environment variables

- **jac destroy** command wait till fully removal of resources

- **SPA Catch-All for BrowserRouter Support**: The FastAPI server's `serve_root_asset` endpoint now falls back to rendering SPA HTML for extensionless paths when `base_route_app` is configured. API prefix paths (`cl/`, `walker/`, `function/`, `user/`, `static/`) are excluded from the catch-all. This matches the built-in HTTP server's behavior for BrowserRouter support.

- **Internal**: Explicitly declared all postinit fields across the codebase.

### PyPI Installation by Default

Kubernetes deployments now install Jaseci packages from PyPI by default instead of cloning the entire repository. This provides faster startup times and more reproducible deployments.

**Default behavior (PyPI installation):**

```bash
jac start app.jac --scale
```

**Experimental mode (repo clone - previous behavior):**

```bash
jac start app.jac --scale --experimental
```

### New CLI Flag: `--experimental`

Added `--experimental` (`-e`) flag to `jac start --scale` command. When enabled, falls back to the previous behavior of cloning the Jaseci repository and installing packages in editable mode. Useful for testing unreleased changes.

### Version Pinning via `plugin_versions` Configuration

Added `plugin_versions` configuration in `jac.toml` to pin specific package versions:

```toml
[plugins.scale.kubernetes.plugin_versions]
jaclang = "0.1.5"      # or "latest"
jac_scale = "0.1.1"    # or "latest"
jac_client = "0.1.0"   # or "latest"
jac_byllm = "none"     # use "none" to skip installation (will install relevant byllm version)
```

When not specified, defaults to `"latest"` for all packages.

### Enhanced `restspec` Decorator

The `@restspec` decorator now supports custom HTTP methods and custom endpoint paths for both walkers and functions.

- **Custom Methods**: Use `method=HTTPMethod.GET`, `method=HTTPMethod.PUT`, etc.
- **Custom Paths**: Use `path="/my/custom/path"` to override the default routing.

## jac-scale 0.1.1

## jac-scale 0.1.0

### Initial Release

First release of **Jac-Scale** - a scalable runtime framework for distributed Jac applications.

### Key Features

- Conversion of walker to fastapi endpoints
- Multi memory hierachy implementation
- Support for Mongodb (persistance storage) and Redis (cache storage) in k8s
- Deployment of app code directly to k8s cluster
- k8s support for local deployment and aws k8s deployment
- SSO support for google

- **Custom Response Headers**: Configure custom HTTP response headers via `[environments.response.headers]` in `jac.toml`. Useful for security headers like COOP/COEP (required for `SharedArrayBuffer` support in libraries like monaco-editor).

### Installation

```bash
pip install jac-scale
```
