## Core Principles

1. **AI-Native** - LLMs as first-class types via Meaning Typed Programming
2. **Full-Stack in One Language** - React components alongside server code
3. **Python & JavaScript Superset** - Use `numpy`, `pandas`, `react`, `tailwind` directly
4. **Object-Spatial Programming** - Model domains as graphs with walkers
5. **Cloud-Native** - One command to production with `jac start --scale`
6. **Human + AI Readable** - Clean syntax for developers and AI models alike

## Quick Install

```bash
pip install jaseci
```
